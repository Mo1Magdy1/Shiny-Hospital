# 🏥 Patient Admission Data Analysis – Phase 3: Descriptive Data Analysis & Visualization

This is **Phase 3** of a multi-stage hospital data analysis project.  
In this phase, we focus on **Descriptive Statistics** and **Data Visualization** to summarize the cleaned dataset from Phase 2 and uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.

> **Note:** This project is implemented in **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**.  
> All three implementations produce the same statistical summaries and comparable visualizations.

## 📂 Visualization Gallery
We generated **dozens of charts and plots** during this phase.  
All images are stored in the [`visualizations/`](visualizations) folder.  
Visitors are encouraged to explore this folder to view:
- 📊 Distribution histograms  
- 📦 Boxplots for outlier detection  
- 📈 Time-series plots for admissions, discharges, and billing trends  
- 📌 Bar charts comparing gender, age groups, and admission types  
- 🔥 Correlation heatmaps for numeric variables  
- 🏥 Hospital and doctor performance metrics  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Summarize numeric variables with **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, and **range**.
- Summarize categorical variables with **counts** and **percentages**.
- Compare trends by **gender**, **age group**, and **admission type**.
- Visualize distributions and relationships between variables.
- Detect possible anomalies or seasonal patterns.

## 📊 Key Analyses
1. **Numeric Variables**
   - Age, Length of Stay, Billing Amount.
   - Summary tables with central tendency and dispersion measures.
2. **Categorical Variables**
   - Gender, Admission Type, Medical Condition, Insurance Provider.
   - Frequency counts and percentage breakdowns.
3. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Monthly admission and discharge trends.
   - Seasonal peaks and declines.
4. **Outlier Detection**
   - Boxplots highlighting unusual stays or billing amounts.
5. **Relationships**
   - Cross-tabulations and correlation heatmaps.

---

## 📈 Results
- Clear seasonal admission trends observed.
- Billing amounts vary significantly across medical conditions and admission types.
- Notable outliers in Length of Stay detected and flagged.
- Gender distribution relatively balanced, but age group differences noted.
- Visualizations reveal patterns not obvious from raw tables.

## 🛠️ Requirements
**Python:**
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, openpyxl

**R:**
- tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, readxl

**SQL:**
- GROUP BY, COUNT, AVG, SUM, DATE functions for summary tables
