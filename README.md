# ðŸ“Š Healthcare Data Analytics Project â€“ Executive Summary

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract
This project applies **end-to-end data analytics** to hospital patient data, progressing through six phases â€” from initial cleaning to actionable recommendations â€” using **Python, R, and SQL** for the same dataset.

---

### **Phase 1 â€“ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Standardized inconsistent entries, handled missing values, unified date formats, and ensured variable consistency across Python, R, and SQL.

### **Phase 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Explored admission trends, patient demographics, seasonal patterns, and hospital utilization through statistical summaries and initial charts.

### **Phase 3 â€“ Descriptive Data Analysis & Visualization**
Quantified patient volumes, admission types, billing trends, and LOS distributions with a rich set of **visualizations** (see `visualizations/` folder).

### **Phase 4 â€“ Diagnostic Data Analysis**
Identified drivers of high patient counts and extended stays using **correlation analysis, cohort analysis, and time-series patterns**.

### **Phase 5 â€“ Predictive Analysis**
Built forecasting models for patient volumes, billing amounts, and LOS over the next three years, stratified by gender and medical condition.

### **Phase 6 â€“ Prescriptive Analysis**
Developed operational recommendations:
- **Optimal doctor allocation** per month.
- **Targeted discharge policies** for high-LOS hospitals.
- **Cancer ward capacity plans** with 20% safety buffer.

## ðŸ“‚ Code Availability
- All six phases implemented in **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**.
- Outputs and visualizations are organized by phase.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Impact
The analysis enables:
- Data-driven staffing decisions.
- Optimized hospital resource allocation.
- Shorter patient wait times.
- Improved discharge efficiency.
- Better preparedness for seasonal peaks.
